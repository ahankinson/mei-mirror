            As a natural-language translation of the MEI schema, the <a href="/documentation/tagLibrary">tag library</a>
            conveys information about the three principal tasks accomplished by the
            schema. First, the schema breaks down the content of music notation
            documents into data fields or categories of information called "elements".
            All of these elements are named, defined, and described in the MEI Tag
            Library. Second, the tag library identifies and defines attributes
            associated with those elements. Attributes are characteristics or
            properties that further refine the element. Last, and perhaps most
            importantly, the tag library expresses the schema structure by explaining
            the relationship between elements, specifying where the elements may be
            used and describing how they may be modified by attributes.

            While two of the basic purposes of MEI are to facilitate the searching
            and display of encoded music notation documents in an electronic
            environment, nothing in the tag library, however, addresses their specific
            implementation. Searching and display are entirely dependent on software
            applications outside the scope of the MEI model.
