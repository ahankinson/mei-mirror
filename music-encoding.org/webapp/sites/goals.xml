            The scholarly community devoted to the historical study of music needs a
            representation that meets the following requirements:
        </p><ul><li>represents the semantic and structural complexity of the entire
                diverse history of Western notation;</li><li>represents the common expressive features of traditional facsimile,
                critical, and performance editions;</li><li>is a public, open standard controlled by the scholarly community;</li><li>is platform independent, which is to say, based on the XML family of
                standards; and</li><li>supports scholarly analysis and a variety of both digital and print
                rendering possibilities.</li></ul><p>
            Therefore, the Music Encoding Initiative strives to create a semantically
            rich model for music notation that:
        </p><ul><li>accommodates the encoding of common Western music, but is not limited
                to common music notation;</li><li>is designed by the scholarly community for scholarly uses, but does
                not exclude other uses;</li><li>provides for the common functions of traditional facsimile, critical,
                and performance editions;</li><li>has a modular structure that permits use dependent on the goals of
                scholars; and</li><li>is based on open standards and is platform-independent;</li><li>employs XML technologies; and</li><li>permits the development of comprehensive and permanent international
                archives of notated music as a basis for editions, analysis,
                performances, and other forms of research.</li></ul><p>
            MEI also aims to create an organisation that can carry out these
            objectives.
