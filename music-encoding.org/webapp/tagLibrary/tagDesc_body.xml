<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="tagDoc" id="tagDesc_body"><h2>&lt;body&gt; body</h2><h3>Description:</h3><p> This element contains the actual music data of the MEI encoding, as opposed to the
      header, front, and back elements, which do not. When the music can be broken into
      high-level, discrete, linear segments, such as movements of a symphony, there may be
      multiple &lt;mdiv&gt; elements within this element. This is the highest level indication
      of the structure of the music. This element is modelled on an element in the Text
      Encoding Initiative (TEI).
