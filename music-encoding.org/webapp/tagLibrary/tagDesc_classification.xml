      of names and terms from locally controlled vocabularies is possible, terms used here
      should come from standard national or international vocabularies whenever they are
      available in order to enable searches in systems that include multiple MEI documents, or
      MEI documents and bibliographic records from many institutions.

            <span class="description">contains a reference to a field or element in another
               descriptive encoding system to which an MEI element is comparable. Mapping
               elements from one system to another may help a repository harvest selected
               data from the MEI file to build a basic catalog record. The encoding system
               from which fields are taken must be specified. When possible, subfields as
               well as fields should be specified, e.g., subfields within MARC
               fields.

               its value need not be unique, it is required to be a single token.

               within a document must have a unique value.
