            <span class="description">contains a reference to a field or element in another
               descriptive encoding system to which an MEI element is comparable. Mapping
               elements from one system to another may help a repository harvest selected
               data from the MEI file to build a basic catalog record. The encoding system
               from which fields are taken must be specified. When possible, subfields as
               well as fields should be specified, e.g., subfields within MARC
               fields.
            </span></p></li><li><p><span class="attributeName">n</span>, optional, xs:NMTOKEN 
            <span class="description">provides a label (name or number) for an element. While
               its value need not be unique, it is required to be a single token.

            <span class="description">regularizes the naming of an element and thus
               facilitates building links between it and other resources. Each id attribute
               within a document must have a unique value.
