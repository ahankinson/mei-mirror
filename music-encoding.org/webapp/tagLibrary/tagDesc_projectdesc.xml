      encoded, funding agencies, etc. together with any other relevant information concerning
      the process by which it was assembled or collected. This element is modelled on an
      element in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).

            <span class="description">contains a reference to a field or element in another
               descriptive encoding system to which an MEI element is comparable. Mapping
               elements from one system to another may help a repository harvest selected
               data from the MEI file to build a basic catalog record. The encoding system
               from which fields are taken must be specified. When possible, subfields as
               well as fields should be specified, e.g., subfields within MARC
               fields.

            <span class="description">provides a label (name or number) for an element. While
               its value need not be unique, it is required to be a single token.

            <span class="description">regularizes the naming of an element and thus
               facilitates building links between it and other resources. Each id attribute
               within a document must have a unique value.

            <span class="description">identifies the language of the word or text phrase
               marked. The values for this attribute are language 'tags' as defined in BCP
               47. All language tags that make use of private use subtags must be
               documented in a corresponding language element in the MEI header whose id
               attribute is the same as the language tag's value.
