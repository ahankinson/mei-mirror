<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="tagDoc" id="tagDesc_revisiondesc"><h2>&lt;revisiondesc&gt; revision description</h2><h3>Description:</h3><p> Container for information about alterations that have been made to an MEI file. It is
      recommended that changes be recorded in reverse chronological order, with the most
      recent alteration first. This element is modelled on an element in the Text Encoding
      Initiative (TEI). 
   </p><h3>May contain:</h3><p><a title="Show description of change-element" href="/documentation/tagLibrary/change">change</a></p><h3>May occur within:</h3><p><a title="Show description of meihead-element" href="/documentation/tagLibrary/meihead">meihead</a></p><h3>Attributes:</h3><ul><li><p><span class="attributeName">analog</span>, optional, CDATA 
            <span class="description">contains a reference to a field or element in another
               descriptive encoding system to which an MEI element is comparable. Mapping
               elements from one system to another may help a repository harvest selected
               data from the MEI file to build a basic catalog record. The encoding system
               from which fields are taken must be specified. When possible, subfields as
               well as fields should be specified, e.g., subfields within MARC
               fields.
            </span></p></li><li><p><span class="attributeName">n</span>, optional, xs:NMTOKEN 
            <span class="description">provides a label (name or number) for an element. While
               its value need not be unique, it is required to be a single token.
            </span></p></li><li><p><span class="attributeName">xml:id</span>, optional, xs:ID 
            <span class="description">regularizes the naming of an element and thus
               facilitates building links between it and other resources. Each id attribute
               within a document must have a unique value.
