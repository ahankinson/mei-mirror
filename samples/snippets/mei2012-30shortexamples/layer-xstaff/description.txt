Description: 
	Demonstration of an unusual interaction of layers across staves.
	Note in particular that the first treble clef on the bottom
	staff comes before the end of the bar so that a note from the
	stop staff can be written in treble clef.  Example from Joseph
	Haydn's keyboard sonata in G minor, Hoboken XVI:44 (Wiener Urtex
	no. 32), mvmt. 1.
