Description: 
	The vocal part contains the original text and a translation.
	In the third measure, the translation has two syllables while
	the original-language lyrics has one.  This is reflected in the
	music with a quarter note for the original lyrics and two eighth
	notes for the tranlated lyrics.  Similar double-stem notation 
	is used for multiple verses when the number of syllables varies
	between the verses.  Example from the piano reduction of Wagner's
	Rheingold.
