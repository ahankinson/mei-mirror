Date:    Fri Aug 14 15:31:19 PDT 2009

Description: 
	Demonstration of how to indicate a cautionary accidental.
	The first subexample has an E-flat at the end of the
	second measure, but there is no accidental displayed,
	since it is contained in the key signature.
	The second subexample displays the flat, which is not
	technically required, but is provided for clarity to
	the performer.
