Description: 
	Demonstration of how to encode turn ornaments.
	The example is from Beethoven's piano sonata no. 1 in F minor,
	op. 2, no. 1, mvmt. 2: Adagio.  The first turn is centered
	above the note it applies to.  The second turn in the next
	measure is centered *between* the note it is applied to and
	the following note in the layer.  Both of the example turns
	have accidentals underneath them; the first has a natural sign
	which means play the lower diatonic note as a natural (B-natural).
	The second has a sharp sign underneath it which means play 
	a sharped lower diatonic tone (F-sharp).  Turns can also have
	accidentals placed above them which indicate the chromatic
	alteration of the upper diatonic tone.
