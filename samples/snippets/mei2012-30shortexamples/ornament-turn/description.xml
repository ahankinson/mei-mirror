	   Demonstration of how to encode turn ornaments.
	   The example is from Beethoven's piano sonata no. 1 in F minor,
	   op. 2, no. 1, mvmt. 2: Adagio.  The first turn is centered
	   above the note it applies to.  The second turn in the next
	   measure is centered *between* the note it is applied to and
	   the following note in the layer.  Both of the example turns
	   have accidentals underneath them; the first has a natural sign
	   which means play the lower diatonic note as a natural (B-natural).
	   The second has a sharp sign underneath it which means play 
	   a sharped lower diatonic tone (F-sharp).  Turns can also have
	   accidentals placed above them which indicate the chromatic
	   alteration of the upper diatonic tone.
