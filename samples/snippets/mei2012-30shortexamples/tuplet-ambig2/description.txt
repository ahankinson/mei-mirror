Description: 
	Demonstration of how to encode rhythms when the visual
	display of note rhythms is ambiguous.  This example is
	from Chopin's mazurka in A minor, Op. 17/4.  The notes
	in the top staff are quintuplet sixteenth notes, but they
	are displayed with a single beam rather than two beams.
	The tuplet notes are also cue-sized in the printed edition.
