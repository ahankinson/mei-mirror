    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p>The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) schema is a set of rules for
      recording the intellectual and physical characteristics of music notation
      documents so that the information contained in them may be searched,
      retrieved, displayed, and exchanged in a predictable and
      platform-independent manner. The MEI rules are expressed in the form of a
      RelaxNG (RNG) schema. Because schemas are intended to be read chiefly by
      computers, they are often accompanied by documentation designed for human
      comprehension. This tag library, which is a comprehensive list of MEI
      elements, is one such piece of documentation. It is intended to serve as a
      reference tool for music encoders. Through the use of natural-language
      definitions and examples, it assists users of MEI in achieving effective
      and consistent markup. Despite translating XML and RNG terminology and
      concepts into more accessible language, the tag library is still a
      technical document that presupposes a minimal understanding of XML and
      music notation. Novice encoders will need to supplement their use of the
      tag library by consulting forthcoming MEI application guidelines,
      attending introductory MEI workshops and training classes, and referring
      to other information sources.</p>
    <p>As a natural-language translation of the MEI schema, the tag library
      conveys information about the three principal tasks accomplished by the
      schema. First, the schema breaks down the content of music notation
      documents into data fields or categories of information called "elements".
      All of these elements are named, defined, and described in the MEI Tag
      Library. Second, the tag library identifies and defines attributes
      associated with those elements. Attributes are characteristics or
      properties that further refine the element. Last, and perhaps most
      importantly, the tag library expresses the schema structure by explaining
      the relationship between elements, specifying where the elements may be
      used and describing how they may be modified by attributes. While two of
      the basic purposes of MEI are to facilitate the searching and display of
      encoded music notation documents in an electronic environment, nothing in
      the tag library addresses their specific implementation. Searching and
      display are entirely dependent on software applications outside the scope
      of the MEI model.</p>
    <p>Throughout the tag library, coded examples augment the narrative
      explanations and help illustrate the roles, relationships, and usage of
      elements and attributes. The MEI schema contains only a few required
      elements, the rest are optional. Therefore, the amount of markup desired
      will vary from one situation to another depending on intellectual,
      technical, and temporal considerations. Creating encoded music notation
      documents for inclusion in union databases may also result in tagging
      requirements that are separate from those dictated by the schema.</p>
    <p>The tag library is divided into five sections. It begins with an outline
      of MEI Design Principles. This is followed by an overview of the structure
      of a typical MEI document and an explanation of terms and conventions used
      in the tag library. Element definitions comprise the fourth and largest
      section of the tag library, and an index by element name concludes the
      documentation.</p>
    <p>Suggestions for new elements or revised descriptions may be submitted to
      the MEI Working Group via the MEI discussion list at
      mei-l@lists.uni-paderborn.de.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <head>MEI Design Principles</head>
    <p>This section of the tag library defines principles and criteria for
      designing, developing, and maintaining an XML-based encoding scheme for
      music notation documents.</p>
    <list>
      <head>Definitions and Parameters</head>
      <item>A music notation document is one that contains music notation; that
        is, any one of a number of "visual analogues of musical sound, either as
        a record of sound heard or imagined, or as a set of visual instructions
        for performers."</item>
      <item>The encoding scheme permits both the creation of new music notation
        documents and the conversion of existing ones from print and other
        electronic formats. However, conversion of existing documents may
        require revisions in content or rearrangement of information.</item>
    </list>
    <list>
      <head>General Principles</head>
      <item>No prima facia distinction is made between a primary source of music
        notation, such as an autograph or published score, and a secondary
        source, such as a scholarly edition based on one or more primary
        sources. The tag set encompasses both, and the encoder must choose the
        elements and attributes most appropriate in each case.</item>
      <item>As an encoded representation of one or more music notation
        documents, an MEI file may be employed as a surrogate for the original
        materials.</item>
      <item>Although the encoding scheme does not define or prescribe
        intellectual content for music notation documents, it does define
        content designation and is intended to be used with available data
        content standards. MEI identifies the essential data elements within
        music notation documents and establishes codes and conventions necessary
        for capturing and distinguishing information within those elements for
        future action or manipulation. While there are a few elements that ought
        to appear in any MEI document, various intellectual, technical, and
        economic factors influence the level of detail of analysis and encoding
        actually undertaken. Taking this into consideration, the encoding scheme
        is designed with a minimum of required elements and allows for
        progressively more detailed levels of description as desired.</item>
      <item>The encoding scheme preserves and enhances the current functionality
        of existing music notation documents. It permits identification of
        document structures and content that support description, navigation,
        analysis, and online and print presentation.</item>
      <item>The encoding scheme is intended to facilitate interchange between
        notational tools. It aims to assist in the creation of more effective
        and consistent encoding, encourage the creation of union databases of
        music notation documents, and permit the reuse of encoded data for
        multiple output purposes. It will also ensure that machine-readable
        music notation documents will outlive changing hardware and software
        environments because they are based on a platform-independent
        standard.</item>
    </list>
    <list>
      <head>Structural Features</head>
      <item>The encoding scheme is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), a
        text-based format for representing structured information. It is
        expressed as a RelaxNG (RNG) schema, referred to as the "Music Encoding
        Initiative" or "MEI" schema.</item>
      <item>Related or complementary standards, such as the Text Encoding
        Initiative (TEI) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
        Interchange, the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) DTD, MARC formats,
        existing notation encoding schemes, etc. have been consulted and
        employed as appropriate. The data model includes a header that is
        comparable to the TEI header, and TEI and EAD naming conventions and tag
        structures have been used whenever feasible. With respect to metadata,
        MEI recognizes the inter-relationship between the metadata content found
        in the MEI header and that of catalog records, authority records, and
        finding aids, and it provides for the use of an encoding equivalency
        attribute for MEI elements corresponding to fields in other metadata
        standards.</item>
      <item>The encoding standard consists of three parts: an RNG-compliant
        schema, a tag library containing definitions of the schema's elements
        and attributes as well as examples of tag use, and application
        guidelines.</item>
      <item>To ensure broad international and multi-repertoire application of
        MEI, existing musical terminology was used in building the data model
        where practical. In addition, a method for localization of the data
        model's names has been provided. Finally, extensive use of attributes in
        the schema permits the refinement of element meanings with specific
        geographic or temporal contexts.</item>
    </list>
    <list>
      <head>Control and Maintenance</head>
      <item>Control and maintenance of the schema and its documentation will be
        provided by a maintenance agency working in concert with the national
        and international music communities, assisted in an advisory capacity by
        other interested groups of users.</item>
    </list>

  <div>
    <head>Overview of MEI Structure</head>
    <p>In most cases, an MEI file, like many other representations, has a
      "header + message" structure. This is a commonly-occurring structure
      because it effectively separates metadata and data. In MEI these two parts
      of the file are called <gi>meihead</gi> and <gi>music</gi> and are
      contained within an <gi>mei</gi> element.</p>
    <p>The <gi>meihead</gi> element contains metadata about the encoded data
      found in the <gi>music</gi> element. The header is modelled on the TEI
      teiHeader element and therefore has the same components as in TEI –
        <gi>filedesc</gi>, <gi>encodingdesc</gi>, <gi>profiledesc</gi>, and
        <gi>revisiondesc</gi> – plus an <gi>meiid</gi> element.
        <gi>filedesc</gi> is required, but the remaining elements are
      optional.</p>
    <p>The <gi>filedesc</gi> element describes the electronic file itself and
      the sources from which it was drawn. The <gi>encodingdesc</gi> element
      documents the purpose of the encoding and the methods used to create the
      file. A description of the non-bibliographic aspects of the creation of a
      work is provided for by the <gi>profiledesc</gi> element. These include,
      but are not limited to, the languages and sub-languages used in the work,
      the situation in which it was produced, the work's reception history, etc.
      The <gi>revisiondesc</gi> element provides a place to encode the revision
      history for the electronic file. One or more identifiers associated with
      the file may be captured using the <gi>meiid</gi> element.</p>
    <p>The <gi>music</gi> element of the MEI file contains the actual encoded
      content. MEI is agnostic regarding the definition of the term
        <emph>music</emph> – it is simply the thing being encoded. It can be a
      monophonic song or a complex symphony – the character of the work is
      encoded by the <gi>music</gi> element's components. The underlying
      assumption, however, is that the music being encoded is or can be
      expressed in a <emph>notated</emph> form.</p>
    <p>The <gi>music</gi> element allows <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi>, and
        <gi>back</gi> components. Critical editions and collections of works
      often contain extensive text, such as a table of contents, an
      introduction, commentary, a biography, an index, etc. In addition to front
      and back matter, MEI can also encode the introductory or explanatory text
      sometimes found between sections of a musical work. Accommodating these
      kinds of text within MEI permits the encoding of music notation and prose
      in a single, comprehensive manner.</p>
    <p>The <gi>body</gi> element encodes the musical content of the work. It
      contains one or more discrete, linear segments, called <gi>mdiv</gi>
      ("musical division"). An <gi>mdiv</gi> is the highest-level indication of
      the structure of the composition. For example, a single <gi>mdiv</gi>
      indicates a single-movement work; however, when a musical work can be
      broken into several top-level segments, the body element may contain
      multiple <gi>mdiv</gi> elements ― movements in the case of a symphony,
      acts in the case of an opera, etc. In order to accommodate a more deeply
      nested structure, such as that found when an act of an opera is made up of
      scenes and scenes are divided into numbers, the <gi>mdiv</gi> element is
      recursively nest-able.</p>
    <p>When the facsimile module is activated, the <gi>facsimile</gi> element is
      also allowed within <gi>music</gi>. <gi>facsimile</gi> contains a
      representation of a written source in the form of a set of images rather
      than as transcribed text. Multiple <gi>facsimile</gi> elements may be used
      when several sets of images are needed, for example, when there is more
      than one physical source. Within <gi>facsimile</gi>, image files may be
      referenced using <gi>graphic</gi> elements and areas of interest within
      the image may be indicated through the use of <gi>zone</gi> elements.
      Elements that mark semantic content may be linked to particular images or
      zones using the <att>facs</att> attribute, which is available when the
      facsimile module is activated.</p>
    <p>An <gi>mdiv</gi> element may contain one or both of two possible views.
      The <gi>score</gi> element contains a traditional, full open score while
      the <gi>parts</gi> element contains each performer’s view of the work.
      Score and parts views are intended to accommodate different methods of
      organizing the markup – no particular presentation is implied, and
      software may render a collection of parts as a score or a score as a
      collection of parts. The explicit encoding of two views is necessary
      because it is not always possible to automatically derive one view from
      the other. In addition, separating scores and parts can eliminate a great
      deal of markup complexity.</p>
    <p>A <gi>part</gi> element contains an individual performer’s view of the
      score, effectively a mini-score requiring all the encoding features of a
      full score. The encoding of individual parts is practical when they do not
      share visual characteristics, such as typeface or page layout, with the
      full score. <gi>part</gi> elements in MEI have little to do with voice
      leading, which can be encoded using the <att>next</att> attribute
      available on all musical event-like elements.</p>
    <p>In both score and part views, the <gi>scoredef</gi> element and its
      sub-elements are used to describe logical characteristics of the encoded
      music, such as key signature, the "actual" key (as opposed to the notated
      key signature), meter, etc. and visual features, such as page size, staff
      groupings and labels, etc.</p>
    <p>A <gi>part</gi> or <gi>score</gi> may be divided into linear segments or
      sections. <gi>Section</gi> elements often function as a scoping mechanism
      for clef signs, key and meter signatures, plus metronome, tempo, and
      expression markings. Their use minimizes the need for backward scanning to
      establish context when the starting point for access is not at the
      beginning of the score. <gi>Section</gi> elements may also be used for
      other user-defined analytical or editorial purposes and may be arbitrarily
      nested to any desired level. There is also an <gi>ending</gi> element, a
      specialized instance of the <gi>section</gi> element that may not be
      recursively nested.</p>
    <p>Depending upon the time period of the notation and the encoder's needs,
      multiple methods of organization are possible in a <gi>section</gi>
      element. When the CMN module is "switched on", measure-by-measure encoding
      is allowed, with <gi>staff</gi> sub-elements within the measure. However,
      when the mensural or neumes module is enabled, staff-by-staff organization
      is expected, a historically appropriate approach for notation styles that
      do not have measures. In any case, layer sub-elements are expected within
        <gi>staff</gi>. <emph>Note that it is possible to use both of these
        organization methods simultaneously by enabling more than one of the
        CMN, mensural, or neumes modules; however, this is considered an
        advanced topic and is not covered in this introduction.</emph></p>
    <p>It is important to note that within the <gi>layer</gi> element, semantic
      events, not visual symbols, are modelled. Events are the typical,
      time-based, discrete atoms of musical data, such as notes, chords, rests,
      etc. While events may have visual properties, modelling symbols places too
      much emphasis on presentational qualities and makes the markup less
      generally useful as a generic music markup standard.</p>
    <p>So-called "control events", such as dynamics, ties, phrase marks, pedal
      marks, etc., depend upon other events, such as notes or rests, for their
      existence. They often do not fit the principal hierarchy of sections,
      measures and staves. Neither can they always be treated as properties of
      other events. Therefore, a second class of events exists in MEI for these
      musical elements.</p>
    <p>Additional document elements may be employed instead of the <gi>mei</gi>
      element. The <gi>meicorpus</gi> element can be employed to create a single
      file that contains multiple MEI instances or the <gi>meihead</gi> element
      can be used to create a "stand-alone" header; that is, an MEI instance
      that transmits only metadata without any accompanying music notation
      markup. Conversely, the <gi>music</gi> element may serve as the document
      element for a file that is expected to be inserted into another XML
      document, a TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) file for example, that already
      provides a context for the included material.</p>

  <div>
    <head>Tag Library Conventions</head>
    <p>The "MEI Elements" section of the tag library contains descriptions of
      238 elements, arranged alphabetically by their tag names. The "Index by
      Element Name" section makes it possible to locate those elements with tag
      names that might be hard to find alphabetically. For example, the index
      entry "bowed tremolo" points to the tag name "<gi>btrem</gi>". The index
      also serves as a concise, easily browse-able list of all MEI elements.</p>
    <p>The "MEI Elements" section presents information for each element as shown
      in Figure 1.</p>
    <p>

        <head>Figure 1</head>
      </figure>
    </p>
    <p><hi>Tag Name:</hi> Short, mnemonic form of the element name that is used
      in the machine-readable XML document. The tag name is the first word at
      the top of the entry. Tag names appear between angle brackets, e.g.,
        <gi>mei</gi>, except in the listings under "May contain" and "May occur
      within". They are always in lower case.</p>
    <p><hi>Element Name:</hi> Expanded version of the tag name that more fully
      describes the element's meaning. The full name of the element is usually a
      word or phrase that identifies the element's purpose. In the tag library,
      the element name follows the tag name.</p>
    <p><hi>Description:</hi> Definition of the element typically drawn from
      standard reference works, glossaries, basic dictionaries, and data
      dictionaries, such as Gardner Read's <title>Music Notation: A Manual of
        Modern Practice</title>, <title>Grove Music Online</title>, Carl
      Parrish's <title>Notation of Medieval Music</title>, the <title>Text
        Encoding Initiative Guidelines</title>, the <title>Encoded Archival
        Description Tag Library</title>, etc. Additional text describes how the
      element is used, differentiates it from similar elements, points out
      useful attributes, provides an illustrative example, or directs the reader
      to related elements.</p>
    <p><hi>May contain:</hi> Identifies other elements that may occur within the
      element being defined. Elements may be empty (e.g., permit no element
      content); or they may contain text (called PCDATA), other elements, or a
      mixture of text and elements. The abbreviation PCDATA (parsed character
      data) indicates that text content is allowed directly inside the element,
      but the text cannot include characters that might be interpreted by an XML
      parser as action codes, such as left angle brackets. The list of permitted
      elements usually includes more elements than are generally needed because
      similar elements share the same content model. This practice eases the
      task of authoring a schema and aids machine processing of encoded
      documents.</p>
    <p><hi>May occur within:</hi> Identifies all the elements within which the
      described element may appear. This information conveys the sense of where
      and how often an element is available throughout the schema. Definitions
      of parent elements may provide additional information about an element's
      usage.</p>
    <p><hi>Attributes:</hi> Identifies all attributes associated with the
      element. Each entry in the list of attributes contains the attribute name,
      an indication of whether the attribute is optional or required, and the
      datatype to which a value is expected to conform.</p>
    <p><hi>Module name:</hi> Identifies the schema module in which the element
      is defined. In order to use the element, this module must be
      activated.</p>
    <p><hi>Illustration:</hi> Some elements have accompanying illustrative
      graphics.</p>
