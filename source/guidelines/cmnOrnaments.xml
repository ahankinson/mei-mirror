  <head>Common Music Notation Ornaments</head>
  <p>This module makes available symbols for indicating ornaments typical of <soCalled>Common Music
      Notation</soCalled> (<term>CMN</term>). These symbols have different resultions depending on a
    large number of factors such as time period, location, composer, scribe, etc. The ornamentation
    symbols here described, therefore, are not bound to a specific realization; they are, instead,
    meant to encode the typology of the symbol and its position on the staff. This guidelines, nonetheless, will also 
  describe commonly accepted realizations for each type of symbol.</p>
  <p>Ornaments are formulae of embellishment that can be realized by adding supplemnetary notes to one
    or more notes of the melody. Many ornament symbols are usually written above or belove a note, but other
    have a more complex written expression such as those that involve multiple notes
    and/or include grace notes to specify conluding turns or variations.</p>
  <p>Ornaments are typically encoded within a <gi>layer</gi> or within a <gi>measure</gi> and are connected to events 
  on the staff via attributes. For example, an inverted mordent over a central C would be encoded in the following way:</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <measure n="1">
      <staff n="1">
        <layer n="1">
          <note xml:id="n1" dur="4" oct="4" pname="c"/> 
        </layer>
      </staff>
      <mordent form="inv" startid="n1"/>
    </measure>
  </egXML>
  <p>Alternatively or additionally, the relationship with a note can be expressed in terms of beats with the attribute <att>tstamp</att>.
  For example, assuming that the following measure is in 2/2, the mordent would be related to the note on the first beat.</p>
  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <measure n="1">
      <staff n="1">
        <layer n="1">
          <note dur="2" oct="4" pname="c"/> 
          <note dur="2" oct="4" pname="c"/> 
        </layer>
      </staff>
      <mordent form="inv" tstamp="1"/>
    </measure>
  </egXML>
  <p>The following sections will introduce each element in detail for all types of ornaments supported.</p>

  <div xml:id="cmnOrnamentsMordent" type="div2">
    <head>Mordents</head>
    <p>
      There are two common types of mordents: <soCalled>normal</soCalled> or <soCalled>lower</soCalled> mordent and 
      <soCalled>inverted</soCalled> or <soCalled>upper</soCalled>mordent.</p>
    <p>The type is specified with the attribute <att>form</att>, which accepts the following values:
      <list>
        <label>norm</label>
        <item>
          <soCalled>normal</soCalled> mordent, e.g., performed as the written note, followed by its lower
          neighbor, with a return to the written note
        </item>
        <label>inv</label>
        <item>
          <soCalled>inverted</soCalled> mordent, e.g., performed as the principal note, followed by its upper
          neighbor, with a return to the principal note 
        </item>
      </list>
