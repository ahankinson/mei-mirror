  <head>Common Music Notation Ornaments</head>
  <p>This module makes available symbols for indicating formulae of embellishment, or ornaments
    typical of <soCalled>Common Music Notation</soCalled> (<term>CMN</term>). These symbols have
    different resultions depending on a large number of factors such as time period, location,
    composer, scribe, etc. The ornamentation symbols here described, therefore, are not bound to a
    specific resolution; rather, they are meant to encode the typology of the symbol and its
    position on the staff.</p>
  <p>Ornaments signify an addition of supplemnetary notes to one or more notes of the melody. Many
    ornaments are usually written above or belove a note; other ornaments have a more complex
    written expression, for example those that involve multiple notes and/or include grace notes to
    specify conluding turns or variations.</p>
  <p>Based on this categorization, MEI offers two methods for encoding ornaments: one based on
    attributes and one based on elements. The following two section address both metods
    respectively.</p>

    <p>All ornaments in MEI can also be expressed as elements. Those ornaments with a more complex
      written expression (e.g. those that involve multiple notes and/or include grace notes to specify
      conluding turns or variations) are better expressed with elements.</p>
