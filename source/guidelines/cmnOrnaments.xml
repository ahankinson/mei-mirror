  <head>Common Music Notation Ornaments</head>
  <p>This module includes elements and attributes for the encoding of ornaments typical of
      <soCalled>Common Music Notation</soCalled> (<term>CMN</term>). Ornaments are formulae of
    embellishment that can be realized by adding supplementary notes to one or more notes of the
    melody. In written form, these are usually expressed as symbols written above or below a note,
    though some have a more complex written expression, such as those that involve multiple notes
    and/or include grace notes.</p>
  <p>These symbols may have different resolutions depending on a large number of factors, such as
    historical context, national boundaries, composer, scribe, etc. The elements described here,
    therefore, are not bound to a specific symbol; they are, instead, meant to encode the encoder's
    interpretation of a symbol and its position on the staff.</p>
  <p>Nonetheless, in order to establish common ground, the guidelines suggest commonly accepted
    symbols and realizations for the ornaments supported by MEI.</p>
  <p>The following sections will introduce each element in detail for all types of ornaments
    supported.</p>

  <div xml:id="cmnOrnamentsAll" type="div2">
    <head>Encoding Common To All Ornaments</head>
    <p>Ornaments are typically encoded within a <gi>layer</gi> or within a <gi>measure</gi> and are
      connected to events on the staff via attributes. The <att>startid</att> attribute is used to
      refer to the <att>xml:id</att> of the starting note. Additionally, if the ornament involves
      more than one events on the staff, the <att>endid</att> attribute can be used to anchor the
      ornament to a concluding event.</p>
    <p>The following example demonstrates the encoding of an inverted mordent over a middle C:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <measure n="1">
        <staff n="1">
          <layer n="1">
            <note xml:id="cmnOrnaments.co_1_n1" dur="4" oct="4" pname="c"/>
          </layer>
        </staff>
        <mordent staff="1" form="inv" place="above" startid="co_1_n1"/>
      </measure>
    </egXML>
    <p>Alternatively or additionally, the relationship with a note can be expressed in terms of
      beats with the attribute <att>tstamp</att>. If the ornament involves more than one event on
      the staff, the <att>dur</att> attribute can be used to indicate the ending time stamp, as is
      explained in the section: <ptr target="#cmnTstamp"/>.</p>

    <p>The following example shows the use of <att>tstamp</att> for an ornament. Assuming that the
      following measure is in 2/4, the ornament (in this case, a mordent) is related to the note on
      the second beat.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <measure n="1">
        <staff n="1">
          <layer n="1">
            <note dur="2" oct="4" pname="c"/>
            <note dur="2" oct="4" pname="c"/>
          </layer>
        </staff>
        <mordent staff="1" form="inv" place="below" tstamp="2"/>
      </measure>
    </egXML>
    <p>The relationship between an ornament and the notes on staff must always be encoded. It is, in
      fact, a semantic error not to specify a starting event or time stamp for an ornament.</p>

    <p>In their resolution, ornaments will involve auxiliary notes, which typically follow the key
      signature or the scale of the current key. When the ornament involves other chromatic
      auxiliaries, an accidental is expressed next to or above the ornament sign. The attributes
        <att>accidlower</att> and <att>accidupper</att>, available on all ornaments described in
      this chapter, can be used to record this accidental. The attribute values
        <soCalled>upper</soCalled> and <soCalled>lower</soCalled> indicate whether the accidental is
      associated with an upper or lower auxiliary note, not the position of the accidental sign.</p>

    <div xml:id="cmnOrnamentsOverride" type="div3">
      <head>Overriding Default Resolutions</head>
      <p>The symbols and resolutions suggested for each ornament in this chapter are to be
        considered defaults. Nevertheless, because of the great historical and geographical variance
        in the notation of ornaments, the encoder is given methods to override the default
        resolutions.</p>
      <p>It is possible, for example, to specify in the <gi>meiHeader</gi> a new default resolution
        for an ornament. As discussed in the section <ptr target="#encodingDescription"/>, the
        element <gi>encodingDesc</gi> holds a description (optional, but recommended) of the methods
        and editorial principles which governed the transcription or encoding of the source
        material. Let us take a trill as an example. The section about <ref
          target="#cmnOrnamentsTrills">trills</ref> does not set a specific number of alternations
        between the principal and the above; the encoder, however, may specify an exact number in
        the encoding description.</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <encodingDesc>
          <editorialDecl>
            <p>All trills should be resolved by playing three alternations.</p>
          </editorialDecl>
        </encodingDesc>
      </egXML>

      <p>Alternatively, resolutions can be defined on a case-by-case basis by encoding a specific
        resolution within the ornament's element. See the section <ptr
          target="#cmnOrnamentsTrillsParticular"/> below for an example of a specific resolution of
        a trill.</p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <div xml:id="cmnOrnamentsMordents" type="div2">
    <head>Mordents</head>
    <p>A mordent is an ornament that involves an auxiliary note a step above or below the principal
      note. The presence of a mordent is encoded with the <gi>mordent</gi> element and its
      attributes:</p>

    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="mordent" atts="form accidlower accidupper long"/>
      </specList>
    </p>

    <p>It is recommended, but not required, to use the attribute <att>form</att> to encode the
      typology of mordents. Two common types are supported: those mordents that involve a note lower
      than the principal note, and those that involve a note higher than the principal note.</p>

    <p>The attribute <att>form</att> accepts the following values:</p>
    <list type="simple">
      <item><label>norm</label> usually corresponding to the symbol: <graphic
          url="Images/modules/cmnOrnaments/lower_mordent.png" width="30px"/>. This mordent is
        commonly performed as the principal note, followed by its lower neighbor, with a return to
        the principal note.</item>
      <item><label>inv</label> usually corresponding to the symbol: <graphic
          url="Images/modules/cmnOrnaments/upper_mordent.png" width="30px"/>. This mordent is
        commonly performed as the principal note, followed by its upper neighbor, with a return to
        the principal note. </item>
    </list>

    <p>The following example demonstrates the encoding of simple mordents:</p>
    <figure>

    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <measure n="1">
        <staff n="1">
          <layer n="1">
            <note pname="c" oct="5" dur="4" stem.dir="down"/>
            <note pname="g" oct="4" dur="4" stem.dir="up"/>
            <note pname="b" oct="4" dur="4" stem.dir="down"/>

        </staff>
        <mordent staff="1" form="inv" tstamp="1"/>
      </measure>
    </egXML>

    <p>Occasionally, mordents can be longer, employing five notes instead of three. The
        <gi>long</gi> attribute can be used to indicate this. The following example shows the
      encoding of a long mordent:</p>

      </measure>
    </egXML>
  </div>

  <div xml:id="cmnOrnamentsTrills" type="div2">
    <head>Trills</head>
    <p>Trills are a type of ornament that consists of a rapid alternation of a note with one a
      semitone or tone above. A trill is encoded with the <gi>trill</gi> element and its
      attributes:</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="trill"/>
        <specDesc key="att.ornamentaccid" atts="accidlower accidupper"/>
      </specList>
    </p>

    <p>Trills in modern notation are usually expressed with the abbreviation "tr" above a note on
      the staff. Often the abbreviation is followed by a wavy line that indicates the length of the
      trill.</p>

    <p>The following example demonstrates the encoding of simple trills:</p>
    <figure>
      <head>Example of simple trills.</head>

    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <measure n="1">
        <staff n="1">
          <layer n="1">

            <note dur="4" oct="4" pname="a" stem.dir="up"/>
            <rest dur="8"/>
            <note dur="8" oct="5" pname="c" stem.dir="down"/>
            <note dur="4" oct="5" pname="e" stem.dir="down"/>

        </staff>
        <trill staff="1" place="above" tstamp="1"/>
        <trill staff="1" place="above" tstamp="2" accidupper="f"/>
        <trill staff="1" place="above" tstamp="3.5"/>
        <trill staff="1" place="above" tstamp="4" accidupper="s"/>
      </measure>
    </egXML>

    <p>It has been specified earlier that it is a semantic error not to encode a starting event or
      time stamp for an ornament. This starting point of a trill can be expressed with the
        <att>startid</att> attribute and/or with the <att>tstamp</att> attribute. Specifying thbe
      end point is not required, although the <att>dur</att> attribute can be used to indicate the
      use of a wavy line extender as shown in this example:</p>

      </section>
    </egXML>
    <p>The <att>dur</att> attribute indicates the ending beat of the trill, not its duration in any
      kind of time units.</p>

    <p>Alterations of auxiliary notes are occasionally expressed on the staff, as shown by the
      example below. The attribute <att>accidupper</att> is still to be used to encode the
      alteration:</p>

        </staff>
        <trill staff="1" place="above" tstamp="1" accidupper="b"/>
      </measure>
    </egXML>

    <p>Some trills may be introduced by a turn or followed by an inverted turn leading to the next
      note (see <bibl>Le garzantine, Musica 2003, p. 911</bibl>). In such cases, the trill is
      encoded as in previous examples and associated with the principal note. Starting or concluding
      turns are notated on the staff (in <gi>layer</gi>) as <ref target="#cmnNotesGrace">grace
        notes</ref>.</p>

    <p>The following example, from a keyboard sonata by Joseph Haydn, shows a trill with concluding
      grace notes:</p>

      <head>Particular cases</head>

      <p>Symbols and abbreviations for trills have changed and evolved considerably throughout
        history. Strategies to clarify the encoding and interpretation of ornaments have been
        discussed in section <ptr target="#cmnOrnamentsOverride"/> above. However, in order to aid
        the encoder in making educated choices in the encoding of non-standard trills, this section
        shows two examples diverging from modern standard use.</p>

      <p>The abbreviation "tr" followed by a wavy line spanning multiple notes can be used to
        indicate multiple trills (see <bibl>Read 1979, p. 233</bibl>). Each trill should be
        explicitly encoded, as the following example demonstrates:</p>
      <figure>
        <head>Example of multiple trills.</head>

        </measure>
      </egXML>

      <p>The symbols for trills and mordents have been often used interchangeably in the past. The
        following example is taken from <title>Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach</title>
        (1720) and shows a trill (<q>Trillo</q>) being identified by the symbol associated with a
        mordent in modern practice. Nonetheless, given the ornament's resolution, it should be
        encoded with the <gi>trill</gi> element. J.S. Bach's suggested resolution can be recorded
        within the element itself:</p>

    <head>Turns</head>
    <p>A turn is an ornament that typically consists of four notes: the upper neighbor of the
      principal note, the principal note, the lower neighbor, and the principal note again.</p>

    <p>The presence of a turn is encoded with the <gi>turn</gi> element and its attributes:</p>

      <specList>
        <specDesc key="turn" atts="form delayed accidlower accidupper"/>

    </p>

    <p>It is recommended, but not required, to use the attribute <att>form</att> to encode the
      typology of the turn.</p>

    <p>The attribute <att>form</att> accepts the following values:</p>
    <list type="simple">
      <item><label>norm</label> usually corresponding to the symbol: <graphic

    <p>Turns can sometimes be performed after the principal note (usually on the second half of the
      beat, see <bibl>Read 1979, p. 246</bibl>) and leading to the following event. To indicate
      this, the turn symbol is typically written in between the principal note and the next. These
      kind of turns are encoded with the attribute <att>delayed</att>.</p>

    <p>The following example from Beethoven's piano sonata no. 1 in F minor, op. 2, no. 1, mvmt. 2
      demonstrates the encoding of turns with the <att>delayed</att> attribute. Note that the
        <att>tstamp</att> attribute indicates the actual starting point in time, while
        <att>startid</att> points to the principal note. <figure>

    <head>Ornaments in Combinations</head>
    <p>Particularly in baroque keyboard music, but also in the early classical period, different
      ornaments can be found written in combination. They are to be played in sequence and are
      usually written on top of each other.</p>
    <p>The following example from C.P.E. Bach's sonata W.62/1 shows a turn followed by a inverted
      mordent:</p>
    <figure>

      <graphic url="Images/modules/cmnOrnaments/ex_multi_orn.png" height="100px"/>
    </figure>
    <p>When encoding the example above, both ornaments will be positioned above the same note. The
      encoded order of the elements, moreover, should correspond to the performed sequence, which in
      this example is top to bottom: first the turn, then the mordent.</p>
    <!-- PR: Encoding order doesn't have to be relied upon.  @to can be used to indicate a time offset from where the sign is rendered. -->
