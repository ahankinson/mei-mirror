    <head>MEI Design Principles</head>
    <p>This section of the tag library defines principles and criteria for designing, developing,
      and maintaining an XML-based encoding scheme for music notation documents.</p>
    <list>
      <head>Definitions and Parameters</head>
      <item>A music notation document is one that contains music notation; that is, any one of a
        number of "visual analogues of musical sound, either as a record of sound heard or imagined,
        or as a set of visual instructions for performers."<note target="n1"/></item>
      <item>The encoding scheme permits both the creation of new music notation documents and the
        conversion of existing ones from print and other electronic formats. However, conversion of
        existing documents may require revisions in content or rearrangement of information.</item>
    </list>
    <list>
      <head>General Principles</head>
      <item>No prima facia distinction is made between a primary source of music notation, such as
        an autograph or published score, and a secondary source, such as a scholarly edition based
        on one or more primary sources. The tag set encompasses both, and the encoder must choose
        the elements and attributes most appropriate in each case.</item>
      <item>As an encoded representation of one or more music notation documents, an MEI file may be
        employed as a surrogate for the original materials.</item>
      <item>Although the encoding scheme does not define or prescribe intellectual content for music
        notation documents, it does define content designation and is intended to be used with
        available data content standards. MEI identifies the essential data elements within music
        notation documents and establishes codes and conventions necessary for capturing and
        distinguishing information within those elements for future action or manipulation. While
        there are a few elements that ought to appear in any MEI document, various intellectual,
        technical, and economic factors influence the level of detail of analysis and encoding
        actually undertaken. Taking this into consideration, the encoding scheme is designed with a
        minimum of required elements and allows for progressively more detailed levels of
        description as desired.</item>
      <item>The encoding scheme preserves and enhances the current functionality of existing music
        notation documents. It permits identification of document structures and content that
        support description, navigation, analysis, and online and print presentation.</item>
      <item>The encoding scheme is intended to facilitate interchange between notational tools. It
        aims to assist in the creation of more effective and consistent encoding, encourage the
        creation of union databases of music notation documents, and permit the reuse of encoded
        data for multiple output purposes. It will also ensure that machine-readable music notation
        documents will outlive changing hardware and software environments because they are based on
        a platform-independent standard.</item>
    </list>
    <list>
      <head>Structural Features</head>
      <item>The encoding scheme is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), a text-based format
        for representing structured information. It is expressed as an One Document Does-it-all
        (ODD) document, referred to as the "Music Encoding (MEI) Guidelines". For more information
        on ODD, please refer to TEI Guidelines chapter 22 (<ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html"
          >http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html</ref>), chapter 23 (<ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html"
          >http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html</ref>), and to the TEI's
        "Getting Started with P5 ODDs" document (<ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml"
          >http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml</ref>).</item>
      <item>Related or complementary standards, such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
        Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange, the Encoded Archival Description
        (EAD) DTD, MARC formats, existing notation encoding schemes, etc. have been consulted and
        employed as appropriate. The data model includes a header that is comparable to the TEI
        header, and TEI and EAD naming conventions and tag structures have been used whenever
        feasible. With respect to metadata, MEI recognizes the inter-relationship between the
        metadata content found in the MEI header and that of catalog records, authority records, and
        finding aids, and it provides for the use of an encoding equivalency attribute for MEI
        elements corresponding to fields in other metadata standards.</item>
      <!-- <item>The encoding standard consists of three parts: an RNG-compliant schema, a tag library containing definitions of the schema's elements and
        attributes as well as examples of tag use, and application guidelines.</item> -->
      <item>To ensure broad international and multi-repertoire application of MEI, existing musical
        terminology was used in building the data model where practical. In addition, a method for
        localization of the data model's names has been provided. Finally, extensive use of
        attributes in the schema permits the refinement of element meanings with specific geographic
        or temporal contexts.</item>
    </list>
    <list>
      <head>Control and Maintenance</head>
      <item>Control and maintenance of the schema and its documentation will be provided by a
        maintenance agency working in concert with the national and international music communities,
        assisted in an advisory capacity by other interested groups of users.</item>
