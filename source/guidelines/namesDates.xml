      <head>corpName</head>
      <p>Corporate names are non-personal names which refer to structured bodies of one or more
        persons that act as a single entity. Typical examples include associations, businesses,
        projects or institutions (e.g. 'the Royal College of Music' or 'the BBC'), but also racial
        or ethnic groupings or political factions where these are regarded as forming a single
        agency. Organization names typically include some type of indicator or pattern or words that
        help identify them as non-personal names.</p>
      <p>Secondary name parts may be encoded in corpName sub-elements. CorpName elements as well as
        corpName sub-elements can be replanished with address-elements to note postal addresses of
        organizations within several addrLine-elements. To enable a localization of an organization,
        it is recommendable to use a controlled vocabulary for names of places and countries. The
        name of the list from which a controlled value is taken, such as the Thesaurus of Geographic
        Names (TGN), may be recorded using the authority attribute. The web-accessible location of
        the controlled vocabulary from which the value is taken could be recorded using the authURI
        attribute. The dbkey attribute should be used to record a value which serves as a primary
        key in an external database.</p>

    <div type="div3" xml:id="geogName">
      <head>geogName</head>
      <p>Geographical names are proper noun designations for places (e.g. Baltimore, Maryland),
        natural features (e.g. Black Forest) or political jurisdictions (e.g. Quartier Latin,
        Paris). Name sub-parts may be encoded in geogName sub-elements. The name of the list from
        which a controlled value is taken, such as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), may be
        recorded using the authority attribute. The web-accessible location of the controlled
        vocabulary from which the value is taken could be recorded using the authURI attribute. The
        dbkey attribute should be used to record a value which serves as a primary key in an
        external database. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

      <p>Music can be devided into many genres different ways. These classifications are often
        arbitrary and closely related styles often overlap. The label styleName describes a
        characteristic style of writing or performance, for example 'bebop' or 'rock-n-roll'. This
        element should not be confused with the periodName element.</p>

       <!-- <p>The Library of Congress Classification (LCC) is a classification system that was first
          developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The system divides all
          knowledge into twnty-one basic classes, each identified by a single letter of the
          alphabet. Most of theses alphabetical classes are further divided into more specific
          subclasses, identiefied by two-letter, or occasionally three-letter, combinations. 
          For example, class N, Art, has subclasses NA, Architecture; NB, Sculpture, ND, Painting; 
          as well as several other subclasses. Each subclass includes a loosely hierarchical arrangement 
          of the topics pertinent to the subclass, going from the general to the more specific. Individual 
          topics are often broken down by specific places, time periods, or bibliographic forms 
          (such as periodicals, biographies, etc.). Each topic (often referred to as a caption) is assigned 
          a single number or a span of numbers. Whole numbers used in LCC may range from one to four digits 
          in length, and may be further extended by the use of decimal numbers. Some subtopics appear in 
          alphabetical, rather than hierarchical, lists and are represented by decimal numbers that combine 
          a letter of the alphabet with a numeral , e.g. .B72 or .K535. Relationships among topics in LCC 
          are shown not by the numbers that are assigned to them, but by indenting subtopics under the larger 
          topics that they are a part of, much like an outline. In this respect, it is different from more 
          strictly hierarchical classification systems, such as the Dewey Decimal Classification, where 
          hierarchical relationships among topics are shown by numbers that can be continuously subdivided.
